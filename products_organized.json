          "description": "\\n✨ Divine Crossing XL v5 Ceramic Heater ✨\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n🔥✨ Check out the Divine Crossing XL V5 Rebuildable Concentrate Heater 🔥✨\n\\nWe took everything you love about the original V5 and made it even better. The XL ceramic heater cup fits right onto your existing setup, so there’s no hassle. Thicker leads mean it’s tougher, and the taller metal top boosts airflow for those smooth, flavorful hits you crave. Plus, the bigger cup walls make cleanup a breeze – no more splashing! 🧼\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n🌀 Upgrade Further with an All-Glass Vortex Top\n\\nEach kit includes a complementary glass top specially designed for the XL cup, we prefer a 14mm glass vortex top with a 4mm tube which will be added to the order unless otherwise specified. 🪟\n\\nThis top enhances your experience with optimized airflow. If you’d prefer a different option, let us know when placing your order. 📝\n\\nFor those looking to customize further, you can also opt for extra glass vortex top. It takes airflow up a notch, giving you an even better experience. Go ahead, make your V5 the best it can be! 🚀\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n⚠️ Instructions & Maintenance\n\\nTake Immediate Caution: Ceramic heater cups can reach temperatures of up to 600°F and may cause serious burns. Please be careful when handling the unit. 🔥\n\\nEach part can be replaced, and the entire unit can be rebuilt. There is no need to discard the whole assembly if one part breaks; we designed it with eco-friendly concepts in mind. 🌿\n\\nThe V5 side and bottom heated ceramic cup with vortex airflow is temperature-controlled, making it the most effective way to conserve and experience concentrates while allowing for maximum vapor at the lowest temperatures. 💨\n\\n\n\\n🔋 Take Note of Battery/Mod Settings\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n  Wattage: 27-37W (Pulsing button) 💡\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n  TCR Value: 200, using 36W to reach 500°F 🌡️\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nUltimately, you will want to practice to get the best experience. Some mods produce more power than others at the same settings. To preserve the side and bottom heated ceramic cups, start at a low setting and gradually work your way up to find a happy middle ground of flavor and clouds. ☁️\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n📖 How to Use\n\\nAlways keep your O-rings clean and lubricated with a vegetable oil of your choice. This makes it easier to remove the top. Place a small amount (2-5 hits max) of concentrate into the side and bottom heated ceramic cup. Keep the unit upright throughout the entire session; do not tip it, or the concentrate will pour out of the cup. Press the button on the mod to start heating the cup and allow the concentrate to boil and vaporize. Now draw slowly; this will allow for maximum vapor and conserve concentrates in the cup from splashing out. Make sure to maintain heat on the cup so that vapor is produced throughout the session. Sessions should not exceed one minute. ⏱️\n\\nKeep the temperatures low enough to avoid burning the concentrates to a char (dry). 🔥\n\\nAlways use a Q-tip to clean the cup after each session to maintain cleanliness and performance. Wipe down and clean the glass top while it’s still warm to avoid reclaim buildup in the vapor pathway. Allow the unit to cool down for 3 minutes before the next session. 🧼\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n🔧 Installing and Maintaining Your Ceramic Heater\n\\nUnder the right settings, both the standard and XL cups should last a long time. When a ceramic heater cup goes out or the resistance rises, you can replace it by unscrewing the two screws that hold the cup's lead wires fastened to the deck. Loosen the screws, gently pull out the cup, and remove it. 🔩\n\\nEvery now and then, you’ll want to burn off residue on the cup. Set your mod to 38W in wattage mode (this can be less for some mods; always start low and see). Hold the unit upside down while delivering only two minutes of heat to the cup, then STOP and allow it to cool completely before the next cleaning session. 🧼\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n🎁 Kit Includes\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n  Complete XL v5 assembled (ready to go) 🚀\n\\n  1 extra XL v5 side and bottom ceramic heater cup 🔄\n\\n  1 extended all steel v4 top 🛠️\n\\n  Dab tool 🧰\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n  4 extra screws, tool and o-rings 🔩\n\\n  Cotton swabs and alcohol wipes 🧼\n\\n  Instruction Manual 📜\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n🌐 Additional Questions or Concerns ❓\n\\n\n\\n  Be sure to check out our YouTube channel for instructional videos.

          "description": "\\n\n\\nV5 CUB with DNA mod customized kit includes:\n\\n\n\\n- Modified V5 CUB\n\\n- Black Silicone Drip Tip\n\\n- DNA (battery not included)\n\\n- V5 Tuned eScribe Material\n\\n- All testing data\n\\n- Exclusive Collab Sticker\n\\n\n\\nSeedmass has collaborated with DVT to release a new kit for Lost Vape Grus, which will have monthly drops of 10-20 units. This kit is designed for beginners who want to experience the best without having to tune and use the v5 themselves.\n\\n\n\\nplease get in touch to ask and questions or purchase\n\\n\n\\nMy website is https://seedmass.dev and email seed@seedmass.dev\n\\n\n\\nA few significant changes have been made to the CUB, including a cut-off metal knurled rim for more accuracy when tuning with temperature probes and brass screws that are ground flat. The tuning process is done using five custom high-accurate platinum PT100 probes, which allows for mapping the surface of each v5 using cubic interpolation. All of this information is used to create a custom material profile that DNA uses.\n\\n\n\\nThe V5 is a staple of what makes Divine Tribe so great! It's perfect for users who want the best possible experience without having to tune it in themselves. This can be confusing for beginners and take some trial and error. Having the heater pre-tuned takes the guesswork out of the V5.\n\\n\n\\nSeedmass highly recommends picking up the Hubble Bubble for water filtration, and all replacement parts can be purchased from ineedhemp.com. The choice of either Thelma or Hyperion, which both support 21700/18650 batteries, is also available. Make sure to purchase a high-discharge battery like the Molicel P42A. The Hyperion is rated IP68, which means it's waterproof, dustproof, and shock-resistant to IP68 standards.\n\\n\n\\nThis drop will open at 1 AM on March 3rd EST with only 10 units. It will be a pre-order with shipping by the end of March. All future drops will not be pre-order and will ship within the same week of order. Only 7 drops will be done for this collab: March, April, May, September, October, November, and December, after which no more units will be sold.\n\\n\n\\n100% of profits go back into the company to allow for the development of cutting-edge technology. Currently, Seedmass is working on high-end rosin presses and an open-source box mod for the v5. Additionally, a tutorial series about the v5 will be added to the website, going through the ins and outs of the v5 cleaning and usage, not just for DNA, but also for Arctic Fox and maybe even the Pico 2.\n\\n\n\\nThank you to all of the dudes on discord especially OGTechWiki!",

          "description": "\\n4-Piece Stainless Steel Dab Tool Set – Versatile, Durable, Built to Last 🛠️🔥\n\\n\n\\nWhy This Dab Tool Set Rocks\n\\nThis 4-piece stainless steel dab tool set includes eight total tip types, thanks to its double-ended design – ensuring the perfect tool for every situation. Whether you're handling wax, rosin, herbal blends, or packaging for industrial use, this set is the most versatile you’ll find.\n\\nEach tool is made of solid stainless steel – no cheap alloys here.

They're the preferred choice in labs, industrial prep, and even medical settings.\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nTool Features\n\\n\n\\n  100% Stainless Steel – Chemical-resistant, rust-proof, no flaking\n\\n  Double-Ended Tools – Eight total unique tip styles\n\\n  Knurled Handles – Improved grip for precision work\n\\n  Multipurpose Use – Great for dabbing, crafting, lab work, or herbal handling\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nCare & Storage\n\\nKeep your tools clean using isopropyl alcohol for quick wipe-downs or deep soaking. This set includes a long-term storage pouch, but you can also store them in UV glass jars or any container – the stainless steel won't degrade.\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nWhich Tool Is Best?\n\\nThere’s no single favorite — it all comes down to user preference. One might love the wide scoop for sticky concentrates, while another prefers the fine scraper for precision. That’s the beauty of this set: it’s fun to explore and find your go-to!\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nPairs Perfectly With\n\\nTry it with our UV Glass Jars or Clear Glass Jars – perfect for storage or soaking tools between sessions.\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nAdditional Questions or Concerns ❓\n\\n\n\\n  Be sure to check out our YouTube channel for instructional videos.

Leave yourself enough room to work since there are many moving pieces with your bb setup.\n\\nWhen removing your device from the bb, we always recommend holding from the base of the banger walls and the metal base of the heater you are using. Then remove the bb vertically with a small twist. Do not remove at an angle — otherwise you will crack the banger walls.\n\\nDO NOT HOLD THE BANGER BY THE STEM. ALWAYS HOLD FROM THE BOWL.\n\\nAlways be sure your o-rings fit tight — the fit should never be loose. Never force the base if the o-rings appear too tight or you may break the banger. Email us about any sizing issues.\n\\nDue to mishandling, we will only guarantee these bangers up to 1 week.\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n🔗 Compatible Accessories\n\\n\n\\n  Glass Dabber Carb Cap by itself\n\\n  Aluminum Carb Cap\n\\n  Magnetic Breakaway Extension Cables\n\\n  SiC Terp Pearls\n\\n  Affordable Dab Rig\n\\n  Perfect Dab Tools\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nAdditional Questions or Concerns ❓\n\\n\n\\n  📺 Watch tutorials on YouTube or join the Reddit Forum\n\\n  📧 Email matt@ineedhemp.com with any questions\n\\n  💬 Join us on Discord\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n#BottomlessQuartzBanger\n\\n\n\\n#DivineTribe\n\\n\n\\n#DabTools\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n",

The Type-C Pico I sell has built-in autofire but is not compatible with Arctic Fox. Ensure you use a micro USB data cable.[](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/threads/istick-pico-75-usb-c-firmware-upgradable.985055/)\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n🌟 Why Arctic Fox?\n\\nArctic Fox transforms your Pico with up to 8 customizable profiles, autofire up to 60 seconds, precise temperature control, and preheat settings. Divine Tribe provides this open-source firmware to keep your solid-performing mod thriving! 🦊[](https://github.com/GD386/ArcticFox)[](https://www.vaposearch.com/how-to-install-arctic-fox-firmware/)\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n🛠️ Installation Steps\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n1. Download NFE Tools 📥\n\\nDownload the NFE-Tools-v190703-21.46 ZIP file. If it fails, try another browser. Create an Arctic Fox folder, unzip the files, and open the nToolbox app. 📂\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n2. Connect Pico 🔌\n\\nConnect your Pico to your computer using a micro USB data cable (not all cables transmit data). In nToolbox, click Firmware Updater. 🔍\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n3. Download Firmware 📦\n\\nDownload the Pico AF Firmware BIN File to your Arctic Fox folder. 💾\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n4. Optional: Stock Autofire Firmware ⚙️\n\\nSkip this for Arctic Fox. For stock firmware with autofire, download the Pico Autofire Firmware. Hold fire and “+” to set seconds, double-click to activate, press once to stop early. 🔧\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n5. Update Firmware 🔄\n\\nIn nToolbox, click Update From a File, select the Arctic Fox or Autofire BIN file, and upload to your Pico. ✅\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n6. Load Configuration 🛠️\n\\nUse our pre-set configuration with 3 profiles for Quest, v4, and v5 Prototype: Download Configuration. Or customize your own with these instructions. In nToolbox, click ArcticFox Configuration, select the file, and click Upload Settings. Cycle profiles by pressing the fire button 3 times. 🔄\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n7. Autofire Feature 🔥\n\\nArctic Fox’s autofire lets you heat for up to 60 seconds with a double-click, no need to hold the button every 10 seconds like stock firmware. Perfect for Divine Tribe atomizers! 🌿[](https://vapingunderground.com/threads/eleaf-pico-firmware-update.283859/)\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n🌐 Join Divine Tribe\n\\nConnect with us!

Discounts on multiples—email matt@ineedhemp.com for wholesale quotes. 🌿👕\n\\n \n\\n \n\\n\n\\n \n\\n \n\\n 🌱 Why Hemp Fabric?\n\\n \n\\n Hemp fabric, derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, has been used for millennia, from ancient Chinese textiles to medieval European sails. Its superior strength—four times that of cotton—resists wear and tear, maintaining shape through countless washes. Unlike synthetic fibers, hemp’s natural properties include UV resistance, blocking harmful rays, and thermal regulation, keeping you comfortable in varied climates. Its porous fibers wick moisture, enhancing breathability, while its antimicrobial nature reduces odors without chemical treatments. Hemp grows rapidly, yielding up to 250% more fiber per acre than cotton, using minimal water and no pesticides, making it a sustainable choice. Despite these advantages, hemp’s popularity waned due to prohibition in the 20th century, which restricted cultivation and stigmatized the plant. Cotton’s industrial dominance and cheaper production also overshadowed hemp’s labor-intensive processing. Today, as legal barriers ease, hemp’s eco-friendly, durable, and comfortable qualities are poised for a comeback, offering a superior alternative to cotton and synthetics for conscious consumers. 🌍\n\\n \n\\n \n\\n\n\\n \n\\n \n\\n 🎉 Benefits of Hemp Clothing\n\\n \n\\n 🌿 Durable, four times stronger than cotton, resists wear after washing\n\\n 🎨 Retains vibrant color better than other fabrics\n\\n 👕 Soft, hypoallergenic natural fiber, gentle on skin\n\\n 💨 Naturally resists bacteria, prevents odor, highly breathable\n\\n 🌍 Sustainable, high-yield crop, uses minimal water\n\\n \n\\n \n\\n\n\\n \n\\n \n\\n 🛒 Colors & Sizes\n\\n \n\\n 🚨 Order one size up to account for washing shrinkage.

          "description": "Black Polished Side Heated \n\\nLightning Heater Cups\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nThese lightning heater cups were designed to give you a new experience with your Quest or Pen Diffuser. We have found that you can build the larger ones onto a v5 base as well and use with a bottomless banger, (see pic).\n\\n\n\\nWhat’s nice about this cup is instead of it being heated by two rod heaters, we have been able to make the cup depth deeper with this extra space. The cup still is the same size as the whole cup for the original quests.

Hemp breathes better, resists mold, is hypoallergenic, and offers a heavier, more durable feel than traditional cotton or synthetic fabrics.\n\\n  Can I wear these pants both indoors and outdoors? Absolutely — these are some of the most comfortable pants for lounging at home and surprisingly warm and reliable for outdoor use.\n\\n  How do I care for hemp fleece fabric? These pants are easy to care for — simply wash and dry like any other fleece in your wardrobe.\n\\n  Do the pants shrink after washing? Yes, they shrink a couple of inches in length after the first wash, which is why we cut them long — most people will want to hem them slightly for a custom fit.\n\\n  Will these pants fit different body types? Definitely — we designed the waist area with a super loose cut and an adjustable drawstring, making them suitable for a wide range of sizes and body types.\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nLooking for more styles?

Made from genuine violet UV glass, they block visible light while allowing beneficial UV-A and infrared wavelengths. This prevents early degradation, preserving flavor, aroma, and potency over time.\n\\n💠 Each jar features a flush-fit cap for a clean seal and uses non-coated, laboratory-grade uv glass. With a 100ml capacity, these jars typically hold 3.5 to 7 grams of flower depending on density and also work well for infused goods, extracts, or organic skincare products. The smooth sides make labeling easy and professional.\n\\n🛡️ This 100ml UV glass jar serves dispensaries, apothecaries, and home storage needs alike. They help extend shelf life by shielding terpenes and cannabinoids from exposure. Whether used for personal stash or retail packaging, they offer lasting durability and enhanced product stability with every use.\n\\n🌿 By filtering light naturally, 100ml UV glass jars preserve the quality of organic contents without synthetic coatings.

          "description": "\\nChildproof UV Glass Jars – Wholesale Direct\n\\n\n\\n🛡️ Protect your products with childproof UV glass jars — now available at wholesale pricing from ineedhemp.com. These specialty jars are crafted to preserve potency and freshness. As a result, they are ideal for storing concentrates, herbs, and other light-sensitive materials safely and securely. Unlike standard containers, UV glass offers superior preservation by filtering out harmful light wavelengths.\n\\nOur premium childproof UV glass jars are made from true ultraviolet glass — no painted coatings. In addition, the lids are fully child-resistant, flush with the jar body, and ready for compliant sales or home use. Moreover, you’ll find these jars sized to match leading European styles at a fraction of the price: 30.4mm tall (with cap), 24.6mm without, and 36mm in diameter.\n\\n🧪 With superior material filtering, UV-protective construction helps reduce terpene loss and oxygen degradation. In turn, the contents retain taste and strength longer than they would in clear or amber alternatives. Because UV glass blocks visible light while allowing only beneficial UV-A and infrared, it helps prevent terpene degradation, mold growth, and premature cannabinoid breakdown. Consequently, we rely on these jars ourselves in Humboldt County and recommend them for retail, home use, and manufacturing environments.\n\\n🧴 Each jar supports sticker label application and arrives clean and ready-to-fill. Whether you're storing essential oils, rosin, hash, or flower, our childproof UV glass jars are a premium choice built to last. Additionally, they make an excellent option for both businesses and personal storage needs. Overall, this makes them one of the most versatile and protective containers available.\n\\nChoose quality & confidence with UV glass jars from Divine Tribe.\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n🧩 Explore Our Full Jar Collection\n\\nLooking for other sizes?

Perfect for conscious consumers, they offer unmatched comfort and sustainability. Hemp’s natural strength ensures longevity, while its UV-resistant fibers protect against sun exposure, making these hoodies ideal for outdoor adventures. 🌿👕\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n🏥 Health Benefits of Hemp\n\\nHemp hoodies are hypoallergenic and mold-resistant, perfect for sensitive skin. Their breathable, insulating fibers keep you warm yet comfortable in any season. Hemp’s natural antimicrobial properties reduce odor without chemicals, ensuring freshness during active use. Unlike cotton, hemp retains vibrant colors and resists pilling, offering a soft, skin-friendly fit that improves with wear. 🌬️🛡️\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n🌍 Why Choose Hemp?\n\\nHemp is a sustainable powerhouse, requiring 50% less water than cotton and no pesticides, reducing environmental impact. Its high-yield crops produce more fiber per acre, supporting eco-conscious fashion. Historically, hemp’s versatility made it a staple for textiles, but 20th-century prohibition limited its use due to regulatory confusion with cannabis. Now, with legalization, hemp’s superior durability, moisture-wicking, and eco-friendly properties make it a top choice over traditional materials like polyester, which lacks breathability and biodegradability. Choose hemp to support a greener planet and enjoy long-lasting, comfortable clothing. ♻️🌱\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n🎨 Colors & Sizes\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nAvailable Colors\n\\n\n\\n  Reactive Black 🖤\n\\n  Coral Blue 🌊\n\\n  Dark Brown 🤎\n\\n  Workout Grey 🏋️‍♂️\n\\n  Mossy Green 🌿\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nSize Chart\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nSize\n\\nLength\n\\nWidth\n\\nSleeve\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nSmall\n\\n21\"\n\\n23\"\n\\n26\"\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nMedium\n\\n23\"\n\\n24\"\n\\n27\"\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nLarge\n\\n26\"\n\\n26\"\n\\n29\"\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nXL\n\\n27\"\n\\n26\"\n\\n30\"\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nXXL\n\\n29\"\n\\n27\"\n\\n30\"\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n📋 Care & Maintenance\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nWashing Instructions\n\\n\n\\n  Machine wash cold to preserve fibers 🧼\n\\n  Use eco-friendly detergent 🌿\n\\n  Tumble dry low or air dry ☀️\n\\n  Softens with each wash 👕\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nDurability Benefits\n\\n\n\\n  Softens over time, stays comfortable 🧶\n\\n  Maintains shape after washes 🛡️\n\\n  Resists fading and shrinking 🎨\n\\n  Long-lasting sustainable fashion 🌍\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n🛒 Ordering & Discounts\n\\nSpecify sizes/colors in checkout notes for multiple orders.

No carb caps, pearls, or accessories are included.\n\\nEach banger is smooth, clean,  precise airflow and 25mm outer diameter.\n\\nWe recommend using the bottomless banger (bb) on a flat wide table with a dab mat, leaving yourself enough room for anything to happen. Leave yourself enough room to work since there are many moving pieces with your bb setup.\n\\nWhen removing your device from the bb, we always recommend holding from the base of the banger walls and the metal base of the heater you are using. Then remove the bb vertically with a small twist. Do not remove at an angle — otherwise you will crack the banger walls.\n\\nDO NOT HOLD THE BANGER BY THE STEM. ALWAYS HOLD FROM THE BOWL.\n\\nAlways be sure your O-rings fit tight — the fit should never be loose. Never force the base if the O-rings appear too tight or you may break the banger. Please make sure to lube your O-rings Email us about any sizing issues.\n\\nDue to mishandling, we will only guarantee these bangers up to 1 week.\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n🔗 Compatible Accessories\n\\n\n\\n  Glass Dabber Carb Cap by itself\n\\n  Aluminum Carb Cap\n\\n  Magnetic Breakaway Extension Cables\n\\n  SiC Terp Pearls\n\\n  Affordable Dab Rig\n\\n  Perfect Dab Tools\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nAdditional Questions or Concerns ❓\n\\n\n\\n  📺 Watch tutorials on YouTube or join the Reddit Forum\n\\n  📧 Email matt@ineedhemp.com with any questions\n\\n  💬 Join us on Discord\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n#BottomlessQuartzBanger\n\\n#DivineTribe\n\\n#DabTools\n\\n",

          "description": "Introducing the Core 2.0 now with the Nice Dreamz coil assembly with the v5 side and bottom heated cup. An easy to use on the go piece with a fully heated high polish ceramic vaping surface. Better engineered than competing erigs on the market, in fact the unit is guaranteed for 1 year for any internal failure of any sort.\n\\n\n\\nNice Dreamz Heater Coil: The heart of the Core 2.0, the Nice Dreamz Heater Coil, offers an unparalleled dabbing experience. With a modified assembly style, we’ve lowered the supportive metal ring around the heater cup. This clever design exposes the edges of the cup, making loading your concentrates easier than ever before. Say goodbye to wastage and hello to precision dabbing.\n\\n\n\\nNew glass top bubbler attachments for more versatility to view concentrates and keep the neck upright. Can be angled 3 different ways on the core with 3 holes placed on the bottom to match with the airhole intake on the base of the core. Check out the options below:\n\\n\n\\n  Round Top Matrix Perc\n\\n  Round Top Strait Perc\n\\n  Flat Top Matrix Perc\n\\n  14mm Hydratube Attachment\n\\n  18mm Hydratube Attachment\n\\n  Recycler Top\n\\n\n\\nNew tops sold separately here .\n\\n\n\\nAdditional Cub base adapter sold separately here to help clean your Core v5 heater coil assembly.\n\\n\n\\nCore 2.0 Features\n\\n\n\\nOne button functionality for ease of use 🔘\n\\nFully heated high polish ceramic vaping surface 🔥\n\\nRebuildable atomizer 🔧\n\\nBorosilicate Glass Bubbler 🌬️\n\\nStainless Steel Carb Cap Tube 🧴\n\\nFour carefully tuned heat settings 🔥\n\\nLow maintenance 🧹\n\\nApprox. 1 hour 45 minute charging time 🔋\n\\n3150mah Li-Ion Battery Pack 🔋\n\\nApprox. 21 full sessions - mixed power settings ⚡\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nWhat's Included\n\\n\n\\nCore 2.0 E-rig Base 🧩\n\\nStandard Core Bubbler 🌬️\n\\nSpinner Carb Cap 🔄\n\\nCarb Cap Tether (Black) ⚫\n\\nSilicone Base Cover/Sleeve (Black) ⚫\n\\n1x Nice Dreamz Coil Assembly with V5 heater installed 🌀\n\\n1x Spare V5 Heater 🔥\n\\nSS316 Dab Tool 🔧\n\\n4x Spare coil Screws 🔩\n\\nScrewdriver 🔧\n\\n2x Spare Carb Cap Tube O-rings 🧵\n\\n1x US Wall Plug 🔌\n\\n1x USB-C Charging Cable 🔌\n\\nCotton buds/Q-tips 🧽\n\\nAlcohol wipes 🧼\n\\nUpgraded Carry Case 🧳\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nCore 2.0 Instructions\n\\n\n\\nHold - Manual fire up to 60 seconds 🔥\n\\nTwo clicks - Activate session mode 🔄\n\\nThree Clicks - Change heat setting 🔥\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nFour Clicks - Display power level:\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n🔴 Low |\n\\n⚪ Medium |\n\\n🟢 Full\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nFive Clicks - Lock or unlock Core 2.0 Base 🔒\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nSession Times and Temperatures\n\\nThe total session time for the Core 2.0 has been upgraded to 80 seconds, including pre-heat time.\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nBlue - 12.5 second pre-heat - Approx. 401°F 🔵\n\\nGreen - 13 second pre-heat - Approx. 428°F 🟢\n\\nWhite - 17.5 second pre-heat - Approx. 464°F ⚪\n\\nRed - 22.5 second pre-heat - Approx. 500°F 🔴\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n\n\\n  Charge your base using the provided wall plug and cable.\n\\n  Fill bubbler from the top, when it is removed from the base. Ensure any excess liquid has been wiped away and that no water has flooded into the bottom compartment. If this happens turn the bubbler upside down and blow into the air hole at the bottom to clear this section. Then re-fill from the top.\n\\n  Place bubbler onto Core 2.0 Base at an angle, ensuring that the hole in the bubbler base aligns with the vapor pathway in the Core 2.0 base, then gently and firmly push it straight down into place.\n\\n  Check small screws in the atomizer base which hold the heater legs are fastened. These need to be tightened so they are firm, but not so much that they cut the wire legs off the heater. When this is done screw the atomizer into the Core 2.0 base.\n\\n  Place the carb cap tube on the base so that the wider angled side sits at the top, leaving the carp cab on the tether so that concentrate can be loaded onto the heater.\n\\n  Select desired heat setting (start low and work up to desired heat).\n\\n\n\\nSee Instructions included with Core 2.0 for more session and usage details \n\\nCleaning\n\\n\n\\n  Wipe out heater with a q-tip after each use\n\\n  Clean the area around the RDA heater weekly to stop residue building up\n\\n  Every month, approximately, wipe out the airway with a q-tip soaked in ISO - allow to fully dry before use\n\\n  Replace bubbler water daily\n\\n  To clean bubbler fill with hot water and shake to remove large residues. Soak in ISO to fully clean. Rinse thoroughly with warm water after soaking.\n\\n  RDA heater can be removed and screwed into a heat sink on a box mod, then run at 36W for 1-2 mins to perform a burn off cycle.
