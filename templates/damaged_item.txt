Hi {first_name},

I'm so sorry to hear your item arrived damaged! That's definitely not the experience we want for you.

**To get this resolved quickly, please send me:**
1. Your order number
2. Photos of the damaged item
3. Photos of the packaging (if it was damaged in shipping)

Once I have those, I'll get a replacement shipped out to you right away.

Again, I apologize for the inconvenience - we'll make this right!

Best,
Matt
