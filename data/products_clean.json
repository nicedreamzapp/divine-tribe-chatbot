If you are interested in distribution to shops and friends please email matt@ineedhemp.com to discuss terms for selling the v3.. Guide for V3 PLEASE READ Ω Divine Crossing Version 3 Rebuildable Ceramic Donut Heaterr Ω- FuckCombustion Discount We recommend the Pico power supply for this heater for the most convenient set-up and use. Here is the link to the full kit. For water filtration please check out the hydratube and attachment. -KIT INCLUDES- Complete V3 with 13mm donut installed ready to go 2 extra replacement donuts and cups Dab tool and Screwdriver 5 extra screws Alcohol wipes Thank you for your interest in the Divine Crossing Version 3 ceramic rebuildable atomizer and taking the step away from metal coil heaters to something cleaner. I believe in tasting the terpenes in my concentrates without a metallic flavor. This is the third collaboration between Shenzhen Crossing and Divine Tribe, we have exchanged drafts and ideas to create a unique diffusion device. Here are a few instructions I would like to pass along to make your experience better. If your battery has a temperature control option please Temperature Control in Ni (Nickel Mode) I have noticed 100x better experience with temperature control rather than just wattage mode. -SET THE BATTERY FIRST- First time using the device start at the lowest wattage or temperature depending on your mod and work your way up. By doing this you are testing yourheater and finding the lowest setting in order to get the best essence and biggest cloud. Find the middleground for the best experience. Not all people enjoy the same settings, some like it hot with huge hits some enjoy easy clouds with more flavor. Find your best setting through practice. If you mess around with trying to fine tune your TC settings, you should try a TCR # of around 190 if you like the temperature on the screen to match the actual donut temp. Probably will not be final, or the best settings for all users on all mods, but I'm getting great, tasty, smooth, cool clouds with TCR 190 and 380-420F, and my infrared thermometer says the donut is the same temp as the screen at those settings. For more information and questions visit the DivineTribe You Tube channel Instructions when using Place half bb sized piece directly on donut, when hitting the vaporizer draw in lightly at first to avoid upward splatter. Hold it straight up and down, Not out and sideways, this will ensure you get a good hit. For best performance do small sessions and keep the piece clean with rubbing alcohol and a wipe. Do not leave in hot cars Do not store concentrates in device Clear out heater after each session Rebuild and Cleaning instructions Find clean area to work so screws do not fall to floor and get lost Unscrew 3 screws at base of ceramic housing Gently pull ceramic housing from metal base Unscrew both screws that hold donut wires to the 2 posts Gently wiggle and remove ceramic cup in an upward motion from posts Be careful with donut wires when removing donut coil from cup they will bend and break easy To Rebuild follow these steps in reverse Each piece can be cleaned separately with rubbing alcohol and a wipe Visit www.szcrossing.com for wholesale orders of 50 pcs or more V3 specs: Overall length- 56.6mm Width- 21.9mm Cup diameter- 11.8mm Inner mouthpiece diameter- 17.8mm Here is a link to the replacement v3 ceramic housing.

Past customers email me for a discount matt@ineedhemp.com For water filtration please check out the hydratube and attachment. Guide for V3.5 PLEASE CLICK HERE TO READ -KIT INCLUDES- Complete V3.5 with 13mm donut installed ready to go 2 extra replacement donuts and cups (New Medium 10mm donut cup, and the Large 13mm donut and cup) Dab tool and Screwdriver 5 extra screws 2 Alcohol wipes Extra set of O-rings Thank you for your interest in the Divine Crossing Version 3.5 ceramic rebuildable atomizer and taking the step away from metal coil atomizers to something cleaner. I believe in tasting the terpenes in my concentrates without a metallic flavor. This is the fourth collaboration between Shenzhen Crossing and Divine Tribe, we have exchanged drafts and ideas to create a unique vaporizing device. Here are a few instructions I would like to pass along to make your experience better. If your battery has a temperature control option please Temperature Control in Ni (Nickel Mode) I have noticed 100x better experience with temperature control rather than just wattage mode. -SET THE BATTERY FIRST- First time using the device start at the lowest wattage or temperature depending on your mod and work your way up. By doing this you are testing your atomizer and finding the lowest setting in order to get the best flavor and biggest cloud. Find the middleground for the best experience. Not all people enjoy the same settings, some like it hot with huge hits some enjoy easy clouds with more flavor. Find your best setting through practice. If you mess around with trying to fine tune your TC settings, you should try a TCR # of around 190 if you like the temperature on the screen to match the actual donut temp. Probably will not be final, or the best settings for all users on all mods, but I'm getting great, tasty, smooth, cool clouds with TCR 190 and 380-420F, and my infrared thermometer says the donut is the same temp as the screen at those settings. For more information and questions visit the DivineTribe You Tube channel Instructions when using Place half bb sized piece directly on donut, when hitting the vaporizer draw in lightly at first to avoid upward splatter. Hold it straight up and down, Not out and sideways, this will ensure you get a good hit. For best performance do small sessions and keep the piece clean with rubbing alcohol and a wipe. Do not leave in hot cars Do not store concentrates in device Clear out Atomizer after each session Rebuild and Cleaning instructions Find clean area to work so screws do not fall to floor and get lost Gently pull ceramic housing from metal base Unscrew both screws that hold donut wires to the 2 posts Gently wiggle and remove ceramic cup in an upward motion from posts Be careful with donut wires when removing donut coil from cup they will bend and break easy To Rebuild follow these steps in reverse Each piece can be cleaned separately with rubbing alcohol and a wipe Visit www.szcrossing.com for wholesale orders of 50 pcs or more V3.5 specs: Overall length- 56.6mm Width- 21.9mm Cup diameter- 11.8mm Inner mouthpiece diameter- 17.8mm Here is a link to the replacement v3.5 ceramic mouthpiece.

Fill bubbler from the top, when it is removed from the base. Ensure any excess liquid has been wiped away and that no water has flooded into the bottom compartment. If this happens turn the bubbler upside down and blow into the air hole at the bottom to clear this section. Then re-fill from the top. Place bubbler onto Core 2.0 Base at an angle, ensuring that the hole in the bubbler base aligns with the vapor pathway in the Core 2.0 base, then gently and firmly push it straight down into place. Check small screws in the atomizer base which hold the heater legs are fastened. These need to be tightened so they are firm, but not so much that they cut the wire legs off the heater. When this is done screw the atomizer into the Core 2.0 base. Place the carb cap tube on the base so that the wider angled side sits at the top, leaving the carp cab on the tether so that concentrate can be loaded onto the heater. Select desired heat setting (start low and work up to desired heat). See Instructions included with Core 2.0 for more session and usage details Cleaning Wipe out heater with a q-tip after each use Clean the area around the RDA heater weekly to stop residue building up Every month, approximately, wipe out the airway with a q-tip soaked in ISO - allow to fully dry before use Replace bubbler water daily To clean bubbler fill with hot water and shake to remove large residues. Soak in ISO to fully clean. Rinse thoroughly with warm water after soaking.

How SIC Pearls Improve Your Experience Silicon Carbide pearls revolutionize your dabbing sessions by: Creating Movement: Pearls spin and roll, continuously mixing your concentrates for even vaporization Extending Heat: Superior thermal mass keeps your banger at optimal temperature longer Reducing Waste: More efficient heat distribution means less material left behind Lowering Temperatures: Better heat retention allows for lower temperature dabbing Improving Flavor: Lower temps and inert material preserve terpene profiles Size Selection Guide Choosing the Right Size for Your Setup: 3mm Pearls: Best for small bangers (under 20mm), crucibles, and tight spaces.

Now sold in both 90° & 45° options. You will notice the quality of this bottomless quartz banger the second it arrives — smooth, clean, and made with quality. Outer diameter of banger is 25mm. Options include: Bottomless quartz banger by itself Bottomless quartz banger with bubble carb cap Bottomless quartz banger with aluminum carb cap and two 4mm SIC terp pearls Bottomless quartz banger with titanium carb cap and two 4mm SIC terp pearls We recommend using the bottomless banger (bb) on a flat wide table with a dab mat, leaving yourself enough room for anything to happen. Leave yourself enough room to work since there are many moving pieces with your bb setup. When removing your device from the bb, we always recommend holding from the base of the banger walls and the metal base of the heater you are using. Then remove the bb vertically with a small twist. Do not remove at an angle — otherwise you will crack the banger walls. DO NOT HOLD THE BANGER BY THE STEM. ALWAYS HOLD FROM THE BOWL. Always be sure your o-rings fit tight — the fit should never be loose. Never force the base if the o-rings appear too tight or you may break the banger. Email us about any sizing issues. Due to mishandling, we will only guarantee these bangers up to 1 week. 🔗 Compatible Accessories Glass Dabber Carb Cap by itself Aluminum Carb Cap Magnetic Breakaway Extension Cables SiC Terp Pearls Affordable Dab Rig Perfect Dab Tools Additional Questions or Concerns ❓ 📺 Watch tutorials on YouTube or join the Reddit Forum 📧 Email matt@ineedhemp.com with any questions 💬 Join us on Discord #BottomlessQuartzBanger #DivineTribe #DabTools",

Discounts on multiples—email matt@ineedhemp.com for wholesale quotes. 🌿👕 🌱 Why Hemp Fabric? Hemp fabric, derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, has been used for millennia, from ancient Chinese textiles to medieval European sails. Its superior strength—four times that of cotton—resists wear and tear, maintaining shape through countless washes. Unlike synthetic fibers, hemp’s natural properties include UV resistance, blocking harmful rays, and thermal regulation, keeping you comfortable in varied climates. Its porous fibers wick moisture, enhancing breathability, while its antimicrobial nature reduces odors without chemical treatments. Hemp grows rapidly, yielding up to 250% more fiber per acre than cotton, using minimal water and no pesticides, making it a sustainable choice. Despite these advantages, hemp’s popularity waned due to prohibition in the 20th century, which restricted cultivation and stigmatized the plant. Cotton’s industrial dominance and cheaper production also overshadowed hemp’s labor-intensive processing. Today, as legal barriers ease, hemp’s eco-friendly, durable, and comfortable qualities are poised for a comeback, offering a superior alternative to cotton and synthetics for conscious consumers. 🌍 🎉 Benefits of Hemp Clothing 🌿 Durable, four times stronger than cotton, resists wear after washing 🎨 Retains vibrant color better than other fabrics 👕 Soft, hypoallergenic natural fiber, gentle on skin 💨 Naturally resists bacteria, prevents odor, highly breathable 🌍 Sustainable, high-yield crop, uses minimal water 🛒 Colors & Sizes 🚨 Order one size up to account for washing shrinkage.

      "description": "NOTE: TWO SIZES of Heaters Larger lightning heaters (Height: 15.5mm Diameter: 10mm) for the Quest Line Smaller lighting heaters (Height: 10mm Diameter: 6mm) for the Lighting pen Please pay attention at checkout and make sure you chose the right option.\n\nBlack Polished Side Heated Lightning Heater Cups These lightning heater cups were designed to give you a new experience with your Quest or Pen Diffuser. We have found that you can build the larger ones onto a v5 base as well and use with a bottomless banger, (see pic). What’s nice about this cup is instead of it being heated by two rod heaters, we have been able to make the cup depth deeper with this extra space. The cup still is the same size as the whole cup for the original quests. The Pen mini heater are a new size of cup we have never used. These heater cups are very similar to the v5 cup as far as material used but instead of the clear porcelain polish we used a black polish for a new look for this type of heater. Some skill and dexterity is required when attaching the larger cup leads to quest. Once built I am sure you will like the tall walls, clean taste, and the vapor that this little cup can give! Options 2 larger side heated black polished lighting heater cups for the Quest (TCR 130 using 28w to get to 500f) 2 smaller side heated black polished lighting heater cups for the Pen (leads are cut short and will only fit pen) 2 smaller side heated black polished lighting heater cups for the Pen plus 1 set of ceramic spacers for the Pen Coil (1 spacer for the brass pin on bottom and 1 for the Positive insulator See Pic ) 1 Pen coil with spacers installed, hex 1.5mm tool and screws. (cup heater not included) Lightning pen spacer set Smaller heater cups are used with the Lighting Pen. Larger heater cups are used with the Quest Diffuser.

      "description": "V5 CUB with DNA mod customized kit includes: - Modified V5 CUB - Black Silicone Drip Tip - DNA (battery not included) - V5 Tuned eScribe Material - All testing data - Exclusive Collab Sticker Seedmass has collaborated with DVT to release a new kit for Lost Vape Grus, which will have monthly drops of 10-20 units. This kit is designed for beginners who want to experience the best without having to tune and use the v5 themselves. please get in touch to ask and questions or purchase My website is https://seedmass.dev and email seed@seedmass.dev A few significant changes have been made to the CUB, including a cut-off metal knurled rim for more accuracy when tuning with temperature probes and brass screws that are ground flat. The tuning process is done using five custom high-accurate platinum PT100 probes, which allows for mapping the surface of each v5 using cubic interpolation. All of this information is used to create a custom material profile that DNA uses. The V5 is a staple of what makes Divine Tribe so great! It's perfect for users who want the best possible experience without having to tune it in themselves. This can be confusing for beginners and take some trial and error. Having the heater pre-tuned takes the guesswork out of the V5. Seedmass highly recommends picking up the Hubble Bubble for water filtration, and all replacement parts can be purchased from ineedhemp.com. The choice of either Thelma or Hyperion, which both support 21700/18650 batteries, is also available. Make sure to purchase a high-discharge battery like the Molicel P42A. The Hyperion is rated IP68, which means it's waterproof, dustproof, and shock-resistant to IP68 standards. This drop will open at 1 AM on March 3rd EST with only 10 units. It will be a pre-order with shipping by the end of March. All future drops will not be pre-order and will ship within the same week of order. Only 7 drops will be done for this collab: March, April, May, September, October, November, and December, after which no more units will be sold. 100% of profits go back into the company to allow for the development of cutting-edge technology. Currently, Seedmass is working on high-end rosin presses and an open-source box mod for the v5. Additionally, a tutorial series about the v5 will be added to the website, going through the ins and outs of the v5 cleaning and usage, not just for DNA, but also for Arctic Fox and maybe even the Pico 2.

Hemp breathes better, resists mold, is hypoallergenic, and offers a heavier, more durable feel than traditional cotton or synthetic fabrics. Can I wear these pants both indoors and outdoors? Absolutely — these are some of the most comfortable pants for lounging at home and surprisingly warm and reliable for outdoor use. How do I care for hemp fleece fabric? These pants are easy to care for — simply wash and dry like any other fleece in your wardrobe. Do the pants shrink after washing? Yes, they shrink a couple of inches in length after the first wash, which is why we cut them long — most people will want to hem them slightly for a custom fit. Will these pants fit different body types? Definitely — we designed the waist area with a super loose cut and an adjustable drawstring, making them suitable for a wide range of sizes and body types.

These specialty jars are crafted to preserve potency and freshness. As a result, they are ideal for storing concentrates, herbs, and other light-sensitive materials safely and securely. Unlike standard containers, UV glass offers superior preservation by filtering out harmful light wavelengths.

In addition, the lids are fully child-resistant, flush with the jar body, and ready for compliant sales or home use. Moreover, you’ll find these jars sized to match leading European styles at a fraction of the price: 30.4mm tall (with cap), 24.6mm without, and 36mm in diameter. 🧪 With superior material filtering, UV-protective construction helps reduce terpene loss and oxygen degradation. In turn, the contents retain taste and strength longer than they would in clear or amber alternatives. Because UV glass blocks visible light while allowing only beneficial UV-A and infrared, it helps prevent terpene degradation, mold growth, and premature cannabinoid breakdown.

Perfect for conscious consumers, they offer unmatched comfort and sustainability. Hemp’s natural strength ensures longevity, while its UV-resistant fibers protect against sun exposure, making these hoodies ideal for outdoor adventures. 🌿👕 🏥 Health Benefits of Hemp Hemp hoodies are hypoallergenic and mold-resistant, perfect for sensitive skin. Their breathable, insulating fibers keep you warm yet comfortable in any season. Hemp’s natural antimicrobial properties reduce odor without chemicals, ensuring freshness during active use. Unlike cotton, hemp retains vibrant colors and resists pilling, offering a soft, skin-friendly fit that improves with wear. 🌬️🛡️ 🌍 Why Choose Hemp? Hemp is a sustainable powerhouse, requiring 50% less water than cotton and no pesticides, reducing environmental impact. Its high-yield crops produce more fiber per acre, supporting eco-conscious fashion. Historically, hemp’s versatility made it a staple for textiles, but 20th-century prohibition limited its use due to regulatory confusion with cannabis. Now, with legalization, hemp’s superior durability, moisture-wicking, and eco-friendly properties make it a top choice over traditional materials like polyester, which lacks breathability and biodegradability. Choose hemp to support a greener planet and enjoy long-lasting, comfortable clothing. ♻️🌱 🎨 Colors & Sizes Available Colors Reactive Black 🖤 Coral Blue 🌊 Dark Brown 🤎 Workout Grey 🏋️‍♂️ Mossy Green 🌿 Size Chart Size Length Width Sleeve Small 21\" 23\" 26\" Medium 23\" 24\" 27\" Large 26\" 26\" 29\" XL 27\" 26\" 30\" XXL 29\" 27\" 30\" 📋 Care & Maintenance Washing Instructions Machine wash cold to preserve fibers 🧼 Use eco-friendly detergent 🌿 Tumble dry low or air dry ☀️ Softens with each wash 👕 Durability Benefits Softens over time, stays comfortable 🧶 Maintains shape after washes 🛡️ Resists fading and shrinking 🎨 Long-lasting sustainable fashion 🌍 🛒 Ordering & Discounts Specify sizes/colors in checkout notes for multiple orders.

If you’d prefer a different option, let us know when placing your order. 📝 For those looking to customize further, you can also opt for extra glass vortex top. It takes airflow up a notch, giving you an even better experience. Go ahead, make your V5 the best it can be! 🚀 ⚠️ Instructions & Maintenance Take Immediate Caution: Ceramic heater cups can reach temperatures of up to 600°F and may cause serious burns. Please be careful when handling the unit. 🔥 Each part can be replaced, and the entire unit can be rebuilt. There is no need to discard the whole assembly if one part breaks; we designed it with eco-friendly concepts in mind. 🌿 The V5 side and bottom heated ceramic cup with vortex airflow is temperature-controlled, making it the most effective way to conserve and experience concentrates while allowing for maximum vapor at the lowest temperatures. 💨 🔋 Take Note of Battery/Mod Settings Wattage: 27-37W (Pulsing button) 💡 TCR Value: 200, using 36W to reach 500°F 🌡️ Ultimately, you will want to practice to get the best experience. Some mods produce more power than others at the same settings. To preserve the side and bottom heated ceramic cups, start at a low setting and gradually work your way up to find a happy middle ground of flavor and clouds. ☁️ 📖 How to Use Always keep your O-rings clean and lubricated with a vegetable oil of your choice. This makes it easier to remove the top. Place a small amount (2-5 hits max) of concentrate into the side and bottom heated ceramic cup. Keep the unit upright throughout the entire session; do not tip it, or the concentrate will pour out of the cup. Press the button on the mod to start heating the cup and allow the concentrate to boil and vaporize. Now draw slowly; this will allow for maximum vapor and conserve concentrates in the cup from splashing out. Make sure to maintain heat on the cup so that vapor is produced throughout the session. Sessions should not exceed one minute. ⏱️ Keep the temperatures low enough to avoid burning the concentrates to a char (dry). 🔥 Always use a Q-tip to clean the cup after each session to maintain cleanliness and performance. Wipe down and clean the glass top while it’s still warm to avoid reclaim buildup in the vapor pathway. Allow the unit to cool down for 3 minutes before the next session. 🧼 🔧 Installing and Maintaining Your Ceramic Heater Under the right settings, both the standard and XL cups should last a long time. When a ceramic heater cup goes out or the resistance rises, you can replace it by unscrewing the two screws that hold the cup's lead wires fastened to the deck. Loosen the screws, gently pull out the cup, and remove it. 🔩 Every now and then, you’ll want to burn off residue on the cup. Set your mod to 38W in wattage mode (this can be less for some mods; always start low and see). Hold the unit upside down while delivering only two minutes of heat to the cup, then STOP and allow it to cool completely before the next cleaning session. 🧼 🎁 Kit Includes Complete XL v5 assembled (ready to go) 🚀 1 extra XL v5 side and bottom ceramic heater cup 🔄 1 extended all steel v4 top 🛠️ Dab tool 🧰 4 extra screws, tool and o-rings 🔩 Cotton swabs and alcohol wipes 🧼 Instruction Manual 📜 🌐 Additional Questions or Concerns ❓ Be sure to check out our YouTube channel for instructional videos.

Each banger is smooth, clean, precise airflow and 25mm outer diameter. We recommend using the bottomless banger (bb) on a flat wide table with a dab mat, leaving yourself enough room for anything to happen. Leave yourself enough room to work since there are many moving pieces with your bb setup. When removing your device from the bb, we always recommend holding from the base of the banger walls and the metal base of the heater you are using. Then remove the bb vertically with a small twist. Do not remove at an angle — otherwise you will crack the banger walls. DO NOT HOLD THE BANGER BY THE STEM. ALWAYS HOLD FROM THE BOWL. Always be sure your O-rings fit tight — the fit should never be loose. Never force the base if the O-rings appear too tight or you may break the banger. Please make sure to lube your O-rings Email us about any sizing issues. Due to mishandling, we will only guarantee these bangers up to 1 week. 🔗 Compatible Accessories Glass Dabber Carb Cap by itself Aluminum Carb Cap Magnetic Breakaway Extension Cables SiC Terp Pearls Affordable Dab Rig Perfect Dab Tools Additional Questions or Concerns ❓ 📺 Watch tutorials on YouTube or join the Reddit Forum 📧 Email matt@ineedhemp.com with any questions 💬 Join us on Discord #BottomlessQuartzBanger #DivineTribe #DabTools",
