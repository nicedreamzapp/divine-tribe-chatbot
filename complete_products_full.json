These need to be tightened so they are firm, but not so much that they cut the wire legs off the heater. When this is done screw the atomizer into the Core 2.0 base.Place the carb cap tube on the base so that the wider angled side sits at the top, leaving the carp cab on the tether so that concentrate can be loaded onto the heater.Select desired heat setting (start low and work up to desired heat).See Instructions included with Core 2.0 for more session and usage detailsCleaningWipe out heater with a q-tip after each useClean the area around the RDA heater weekly to stop residue building upEvery month, approximately, wipe out the airway with a q-tip soaked in ISO – allow to fully dry before useReplace bubbler water dailyTo clean bubbler fill with hot water and shake to remove large residues.

    "full_description": "✨ Divine Crossing XL v5 Ceramic Heater ✨🔥✨ Check out theDivine Crossing XL V5 Rebuildable Concentrate Heater🔥✨We took everything you love about the original V5 and made it even better. The XL ceramic heater cup fits right onto your existing setup, so there’s no hassle. Thicker leads mean it’s tougher, and the taller metal top boosts airflow for those smooth, flavorful hits you crave. Plus, the bigger cup walls make cleanup a breeze – no more splashing! 🧼🌀 Upgrade Further with an All-Glass Vortex TopEach kit includes a complementary glass top specially designed for the XL cup, we prefer a 14mm glass vortex top with a 4mm tube which will be added to the order unless otherwise specified. 🪟This top enhances your experience with optimized airflow. If you’d prefer a different option, let us know when placing your order. 📝For those looking to customize further, you can also opt for extra glass vortex top. It takes airflow up a notch, giving you an even better experience. Go ahead, make your V5 the best it can be! 🚀⚠️ Instructions & MaintenanceTake Immediate Caution:Ceramic heater cupscan reach temperatures of up to600°Fand may cause serious burns. Please be careful when handling the unit. 🔥Each part can be replaced, and the entire unit can be rebuilt. There is no need to discard the whole assembly if one part breaks; we designed it with eco-friendly concepts in mind. 🌿The V5 side and bottom heated ceramic cup with vortex airflow is temperature-controlled, making it the most effective way to conserve and experience concentrates while allowing for maximum vapor at the lowest temperatures. 💨🔋 Take Note of Battery/Mod SettingsWattage:27-37W (Pulsing button) 💡TCR Value:200, using 36W to reach 500°F 🌡️Ultimately, you will want to practice to get the best experience. Some mods produce more power than others at the same settings. To preserve the side and bottom heated ceramic cups, start at a low setting and gradually work your way up to find a happy middle ground of flavor and clouds. ☁️📖 How to UseAlways keep your O-rings clean and lubricated with a vegetable oil of your choice. This makes it easier to remove the top. Place a small amount (2-5 hits max) of concentrate into the side and bottom heated ceramic cup. Keep the unit upright throughout the entire session; do not tip it, or the concentrate will pour out of the cup. Press the button on the mod to start heating the cup and allow the concentrate to boil and vaporize. Now draw slowly; this will allow for maximum vapor and conserve concentrates in the cup from splashing out. Make sure to maintain heat on the cup so that vapor is produced throughout the session. Sessions should not exceed one minute. ⏱️Keep the temperatures low enough to avoid burning the concentrates to a char (dry). 🔥Always use a Q-tip to clean the cup after each session to maintain cleanliness and performance. Wipe down and clean the glass top while it’s still warm to avoid reclaim buildup in the vapor pathway. Allow the unit to cool down for 3 minutes before the next session. 🧼🔧 Installing and Maintaining Your Ceramic HeaterUnder the right settings, both the standard and XL cups should last a long time. When a ceramic heater cup goes out or the resistance rises, you can replace it by unscrewing the two screws that hold the cup’s lead wires fastened to the deck. Loosen the screws, gently pull out the cup, and remove it. 🔩Every now and then, you’ll want to burn off residue on the cup. Set your mod to 38W in wattage mode (this can be less for some mods; always start low and see). Hold the unit upside down while delivering only two minutes of heat to the cup, thenSTOPand allow it to cool completely before the next cleaning session. 🧼🎁 Kit IncludesComplete XL v5 assembled (ready to go) 🚀1 extra XL v5 side and bottom ceramic heater cup 🔄1 extended all steel v4 top 🛠️Dab tool 🧰4 extra screws, tool and o-rings 🔩Cotton swabs and alcohol wipes 🧼Instruction Manual 📜🌐 Additional Questions or Concerns ❓Be sure to check out ourYouTubechannel for instructional videos.

Its high-yield crops produce more fiber per acre, supporting eco-conscious fashion. Historically, hemp’s versatility made it a staple for textiles, but 20th-century prohibition limited its use due to regulatory confusion with cannabis.

Hypoallergenic, mold-resistant, and breathable, it keeps you warm yet cool. Order one size up for shrinkage. Discounts on multiples—emailmatt@ineedhemp.comfor wholesale quotes. 🌿👕🌱 Why Hemp Fabric?Hemp fabric, derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, has been used for millennia, from ancient Chinese textiles to medieval European sails. Its superior strength—four times that of cotton—resists wear and tear, maintaining shape through countless washes. Unlike synthetic fibers, hemp’s natural properties include UV resistance, blocking harmful rays, and thermal regulation, keeping you comfortable in varied climates. Its porous fibers wick moisture, enhancing breathability, while its antimicrobial nature reduces odors without chemical treatments. Hemp grows rapidly, yielding up to 250% more fiber per acre than cotton, using minimal water and no pesticides, making it a sustainable choice. Despite these advantages, hemp’s popularity waned due to prohibition in the 20th century, which restricted cultivation and stigmatized the plant. Cotton’s industrial dominance and cheaper production also overshadowed hemp’s labor-intensive processing. Today, as legal barriers ease, hemp’s eco-friendly, durable, and comfortable qualities are poised for a comeback, offering a superior alternative to cotton and synthetics for conscious consumers. 🌍🎉 Benefits of Hemp Clothing🌿 Durable, four times stronger than cotton, resists wear after washing🎨 Retains vibrant color better than other fabrics👕 Soft, hypoallergenic natural fiber, gentle on skin💨 Naturally resists bacteria, prevents odor, highly breathable🌍 Sustainable, high-yield crop, uses minimal water🛒 Colors & Sizes🚨 Order one size up to account for washing shrinkage.

This kit is designed for beginners who want to experience the best without having to tune and use the v5 themselves.please get in touch to ask and questions or purchaseMy website ishttps://seedmass.devand email seed@seedmass.devA few significant changes have been made to the CUB, including a cut-off metal knurled rim for more accuracy when tuning with temperature probes and brass screws that are ground flat. The tuning process is done using five custom high-accurate platinum PT100 probes, which allows for mapping the surface of each v5 using cubic interpolation. All of this information is used to create a custom material profile that DNA uses.The V5 is a staple of what makes Divine Tribe so great! It’s perfect for users who want the best possible experience without having to tune it in themselves. This can be confusing for beginners and take some trial and error. Having the heater pre-tuned takes the guesswork out of the V5.Seedmass highly recommends picking up the Hubble Bubble for water filtration, and all replacement parts can be purchased from ineedhemp.com. The choice of either Thelma or Hyperion, which both support 21700/18650 batteries, is also available. Make sure to purchase a high-discharge battery like the Molicel P42A. The Hyperion is rated IP68, which means it’s waterproof, dustproof, and shock-resistant to IP68 standards.This drop will open at 1 AM on March 3rd EST with only 10 units. It will be a pre-order with shipping by the end of March. All future drops will not be pre-order and will ship within the same week of order. Only 7 drops will be done for this collab: March, April, May, September, October, November, and December, after which no more units will be sold.100% of profits go back into the company to allow for the development of cutting-edge technology. Currently, Seedmass is working on high-end rosin presses and an open-source box mod for the v5. Additionally, a tutorial series about the v5 will be added to the website, going through the ins and outs of the v5 cleaning and usage, not just for DNA, but also for Arctic Fox and maybe even the Pico 2.Thank you to all of the dudes on discord especially OGTechWiki!",

    "full_description": "Childproof UV Glass Jars – Wholesale Direct🛡️Protect your products with childproof UV glass jars— now available at wholesale pricing from ineedhemp.com. These specialty jars are crafted to preserve potency and freshness. As a result, they are ideal for storing concentrates, herbs, and other light-sensitive materials safely and securely.Unlike standard containers, UV glass offers superior preservation by filtering out harmful light wavelengths.Our premiumchildproof UV glass jarsare made from true ultraviolet glass — no painted coatings. In addition, the lids are fully child-resistant, flush with the jar body, and ready for compliant sales or home use. Moreover, you’ll find these jars sized to match leading European styles at a fraction of the price: 30.4mm tall (with cap), 24.6mm without, and 36mm in diameter.🧪 With superior material filtering, UV-protective construction helps reduce terpene loss and oxygen degradation. In turn, the contents retain taste and strength longer than they would in clear or amber alternatives. Because UV glass blocks visible light while allowing only beneficial UV-A and infrared, it helps prevent terpene degradation, mold growth, and premature cannabinoid breakdown. Consequently, we rely on these jars ourselves in Humboldt County and recommend them for retail, home use, and manufacturing environments.🧴 Each jar supports sticker label application and arrives clean and ready-to-fill. Whether you’re storing essential oils, rosin, hash, or flower, ourchildproof UV glass jarsare a premium choice built to last. Additionally, they make an excellent option for both businesses and personal storage needs. Overall, this makes them one of the most versatile and protective containers available.Choose quality & confidence with UV glass jars from Divine Tribe.🧩 Explore Our Full Jar CollectionLooking for other sizes?

Leave yourself enough room to work since there are many moving pieces with your bb setup.When removing your device from the bb, we always recommend holding from the base of the banger walls and the metal base of the heater you are using. Then remove the bb vertically with a small twist. Do not remove at an angle — otherwise you will crack the banger walls.DO NOT HOLD THE BANGER BY THE STEM. ALWAYS HOLD FROM THE BOWL.Always be sure your o-rings fit tight — the fit should never be loose. Never force the base if the o-rings appear too tight or you may break the banger.

No carb caps, pearls, or accessories are included.Each banger is smooth, clean,  precise airflow and 25mm outer diameter.We recommend using the bottomless banger (bb) on a flat wide table with a dab mat, leaving yourself enough room for anything to happen. Leave yourself enough room to work since there are many moving pieces with your bb setup.When removing your device from the bb, we always recommend holding from the base of the banger walls and the metal base of the heater you are using. Then remove the bb vertically with a small twist. Do not remove at an angle — otherwise you will crack the banger walls.DO NOT HOLD THE BANGER BY THE STEM. ALWAYS HOLD FROM THE BOWL.Always be sure your O-rings fit tight — the fit should never be loose. Never force the base if the O-rings appear too tight or you may break the banger. Please make sure to lube your O-rings Email us about any sizing issues.Due to mishandling, we will only guarantee these bangers up to 1 week.🔗 Compatible AccessoriesGlass Dabber Carb Cap by itselfAluminum Carb CapMagnetic Breakaway Extension CablesSiC Terp PearlsAffordable Dab RigPerfect Dab ToolsAdditional Questions or Concerns ❓📺 Watch tutorials onYouTubeor join theReddit Forum📧 Emailmatt@ineedhemp.comwith any questions💬 Join us onDiscord#BottomlessQuartzBanger#DivineTribe#DabTools",

The cup still is the same size as the whole cup for the original quests.
